TODO list:
   * An example to help users jumpstart
   * Read configurations from file, instead of writting in '.py' file. 
   (avoid commiting in those secrets by mistake...
   	used to happen in another project...)
   * Upgrade '.gitignore' file to avoid commiting in 
   non-source files. (e.g. '.pyc')
