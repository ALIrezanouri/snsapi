auxiliary 
====

This folder contains auxiliary scritps. 
In principle, they are not a necesary part of 'snsapi'. 
Some of them are useful to make your deployment individulized. 
Without those scripts, your 'snsapi' should still 
work well by default. 

File list
----

   * 'request_url.sh'. Request url through 'wget', instead of default webbrowser.
   * 'fetch_code.sh'. Pull authenticated code to local storage.
